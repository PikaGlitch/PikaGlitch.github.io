                        Welcome to my edgy webpage! Currently I'm not using this site for anything yet as it is under construction. I am planning to have content on here such as:<br><br><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hex downloads for the old PF Magic Petz games</li><br>
                            <li>UB Funkey mods</li><br>
                            <li>Downloads for things I program</li><br>
                            <li>Maybe some homebrew stuff</li><br>
                            <li>Anything I think of to put here!</li><br>
                        </ul><br>
                        None of the images used on this page are mine in any way, they are all placeholders. I will eventually replace them with my own images or have credit where credit is due :)<br><br><br>
                        Anything you would like me to put on here? DM my <a href="https://twitter.com/pikaglitch">Twitter</a>
